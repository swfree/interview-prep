Lookups of non-existent properties in an object. Function parameters that have not passed. Anything that has been set to the value of undefined. Any expression in the form of void(expression). The value of the global variable undefinednull means empty or non-existent value which is used by programmers to indicate “no value”. null is a primitive value and you can assign null to any variable. null is not an object, it is a primitive value.

Hence, if both sides are not same type, answer is always false. For example, if you are comparing two strings, they must have identical character sets. For other primitives (number, boolean) must share the same value.          Rule for implicit coercion: Comparison by using == does implicit type conversion under the hood. And rules for implicit coercion are as follows-          \n            If both operands are same type use ===\n            undefined == null\n            If one operands is string another is number, convert string to number\n            If one is boolean and another is non-boolean, convert boolean to number and then perform comparison\n            While comparing a string or number to an object, try to convert the object to a primitive type and then try to compare\n         Be careful while comparing objects, identifiers must reference the same objects or same array.",

This means it compares whether two objects are referring to the same location in memory. Equality check will check whether two objects have same value for same property. To check that, you can get the keys for both the objects. If the number of properties doesn't match, these two objects are not equal. Secondly, you will check each property whether they have the same value. If all the properties have same value, they are equal",

Availability is often expressed as a percentage indicating how much uptime is expected from a particular system or component in a given period of time, where a value of 100% would indicate that the system never fails. For instance, a system that guarantees 99% of availability in a period of one year can have up to 3.65 days of downtime (1%).

        "question": "What Makes a System Highly Available?",
        "answer": "One of the goals of high availability is to eliminate single points of failure in your infrastructure.  A single point of failure is a component of your technology stack that would cause a service interruption if it became unavailable.  As such, any component that is a requisite for the proper functionality of your application that does not have redundancy is considered to be a single point of failure. To eliminate single points of failure, each layer of your stack must be prepared for redundancy. For instance, imagine you have an infrastructure consisting of two identical, redundant web servers behind a load balancer. The traffic coming from clients will be equally distributed between the web servers, but if one of the servers goes down, the load balancer will redirect all traffic to the remaining online server. The web server layer in this scenario is not a single point of failure because: redundant components for the same task are in place, the mechanism on top of this layer (the load balancer) is able to detect failures in the components and adapt its behavior for a timely recovery. But what happens if the load balancer goes offline? With the described scenario, which is not uncommon in real life, the load balancing layer itself remains a single point of failure. Eliminating this remaining single point of failure, however, can be challenging; even though you can easily configure an additional load balancer to achieve redundancy, there isn’t an obvious point above the load balancers to implement failure detection and recovery.Redundancy alone cannot guarantee high availability. A mechanism must be in place for detecting failures and taking action when one of the components of your stack becomes unavailable. Failure detection and recovery for redundant systems can be implemented using a top-to-bottom approach: the layer on top becomes responsible for monitoring the layer immediately beneath it for failures. In our previous example scenario, the load balancer is the top layer. If one of the web servers (bottom layer) becomes unavailable, the load balancer will stop redirecting requests for that specific server.",

        "question": "What Is Scalability?",
        "answer": "Scalability is the ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of load by adding more resources. The adding of resource can be done in two ways: Scaling Up (This involves adding more resources to the existing nodes. For example, adding more RAM, Storage or processing power.), Scaling Out (This involves adding more nodes to support more users.)",

This is popular since many clients may be using  middle tier and a lot of heavy load may also be served by middle tier that requires it be to highly available. Failure of middle tier can cause multiple clients and systems to fail, therefore its one of the approaches to do clustering at the middle tier of a application. In java world, it is really common to have EJB server clusters that are used by many clients. In general any application that has a business logic that can be shared across multiple client can use a middle tier cluster for high availability.",

        "answer": "In a load balanced server application where user information is stored in session it will be required to keep the session data available to all machines. This can be avoided by always serving a particular user session request from one machine. How? The machine is associated with a session as soon as the session is created. All the requests in a particular session are always redirected to the associated machine. This ensures the user data is only at one machine and load is also shared. In Java world, this is typically done by using jsessionid cookie. The cookie is sent to the client for the first request and every subsequent request by client must be containing that same cookie to identify the session.",

        "answer": "The client browser may not support cookies, and your load balancer will not be able to identify if a request belongs to a session. This may cause strange behavior for the users who use no cookie based browsers. In case one of the machine fails or goes down, the user information (served by that machine) will be lost and there will be no way to recover user session.",

        "answer": "IP address affinity is another popular way to do load balancing. In this approach, the client IP address is associated with a server node. All requests from a client IP address are served by one server node. This approach can be really easy to implement since IP address is always available in a HTTP request header and no additional settings need to be performed. This type of load balancing can be useful if you clients are likely to have disabled cookies. However there is a down side of this approach. If many of your users are behind a NATed IP address then all of them will end up using the same server node. This may cause uneven load on your server nodes.",

        "answer": "Fail over means switching to another machine when one of the machine fails. Fail over is a important technique in achieving high availability. Typically a load balancer is  configured to fail over to another machine when the main machie fails. To achieve least down time, most load balancer support a feature of heart beat check. This ensures that target machine is responding. As soon as a hear beat signal fails, load balancer stops sending request to that machine and redirects to other machines or cluster.",

        "answer": "Session replication is used in application server clusters to achieve session failover.A user session is replicated to other machines of a cluster, every time the session data changes. If a machine fails, the load balancer can simply send incoming requests to another server in the cluster. The user can be sent to any server in the cluster since all machines in a cluster have copy of the session. Session replication may allow your application to have session failover but it may require you to have extra cost in terms of memory and network bandwidth.",

        "question": "What Is Sharding?",
        "answer": "Sharding is a architectural approach that distributes a single logical database system into a cluster of machines. Sharding is Horizontal partitioning design scheme. In this database design rows of a database table are stored separately, instead of splitting into columns (like in normalization and vertical partitioning). Each partition is called as a shard, which can be independently located on a separate database server or physical location. Sharding makes a database system highly scalable.  The total number of rows in each table in each database is reduced since the tables are divided and distributed into multiple servers. This reduces the index size, which generally means improved search performance. The most common approach for creating shards is by the use of consistent hashing of a unique id in application (e.g. user id).  Downsides: It requires application to be aware of the data location. If you require lot of cross node join queries then your performance will be really bad. Therefore, knowing how the data will be used for querying becomes really important.",

Consistency - This property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Isolation  - This property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially.

There are a few best practices that we can follow: Before deploying on Production: Thoroughly test the new changes and ensure it working in a test environment which is almost identical to production system. If possible do automation of test cases as much as possible. We use selenium for a lot of functional testing.Create a automated sanity testing script (also called as smoke test) that can be run on production (without affecting real data). These are typically readonly type of test cases. However depending on your application needs you can add more cases to this. Make sure it can be run quickly by keeping it short. Create scripts for all manual tasks(if possible), avoiding any hand typing mistakes during day of deployment. Rehearse. Deploy in a non-prod environment is almost identical to production; with production volumes if possible;... When doing deploying on a production environment.Keep backup of current site/data to be able to rollback.Use sanity test cases",
